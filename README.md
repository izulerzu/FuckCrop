gets rid of twitter's dumb crop, and their new font "Chirp", made in conjunction with source code from the Twitter Large Thumbnails extension by m8u ([@meight_u on twitter](https://twitter.com/meight_u)), [go support them](https://ko-fi.com/meight_u), and from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/yourcompanionAI/status/1425512038625841156).
